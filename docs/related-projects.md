    - The original source for this forked repo. So far over the years, it looks like no activity there since I've forked it.
- [rbuchberger/jekyll_picture_tag](https://github.com/rbuchberger/jekyll_picture_tag) 
    - Another gem to resize images. 
    - It is more complex but has more features like generating multiple resized images and setting `srcset` attribute in the `img` tag. So the browser can pick the optimal image to fetch.
    - See [srcset](https://html.com/attributes/img-srcset/) HTML guide.
