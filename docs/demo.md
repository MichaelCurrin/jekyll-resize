This filter is especially useful if you have a gallery of say 20 images and loading all full-sized images would be terribly slow. 

Once you have the thumbnails embedded on the page, you can easily link each to the original full-size image so it can open in a modal overlay or a separate page. 

Here is a Jekyll project of mine that uses this `jekyll-resize` filter for a gallery as small images. And then you can click the images to see larger versions.
